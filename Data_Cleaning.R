Also, the data that is available stems from different years, namely 2009 and 2011. This also does not correspond to the year in which elections have been held. todo: compare the number 
# of parties of 2009 for the elections that have been held, no necessarly the same.

## World Bank (Inflation, GDP Growth and GDP per Capita)

# As to the GDP per Capita, we do not know which GDP per Capita measure they have used, specifically whether they have used the GDP measured in local currency without depriciation adjustment or GDP measured in current US Dollar. We chose real GDP per capita. 
# We use Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)	GDP growth (annual %)	GDP per capita (constant 2010 US$)
